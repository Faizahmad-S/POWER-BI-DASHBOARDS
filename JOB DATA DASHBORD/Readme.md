## Introduction
As someone starting out in the data field, I created this Power BI dashboard to improve my skills and gain hands-on experience with real data. One of the biggest challenges I’ve faced as a beginner is understanding the job market information is scattered, inconsistent, and hard to compare.

To solve this for myself (and others like me), I built a dashboard using a dataset of 2024 data science job postings provided by **Luke Barousse** in his [Powerbi-Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FwjaHCVNBWA&t=15047s). It brings important details such as job titles, salaries, and locations into a single place so anyone exploring a data career can quickly understand the market.

## Skills I Learned & Practiced 
This project helped me strengthen my Power BI fundamentals while also learning how to build a clean, functional report. Here’s what I focused on:

- **⚙️ Data Cleaning with Power Query:**
I practiced shaping raw data by fixing blanks, correcting data types, and creating new useful columns.

- **🧮 Creating Basic Quick Measures:**
Learned to build Quick measures like **star ratings** to support meaningful insights.

- **📊 Visualizations:**
Used basic chart types : **Column, Bar, Line,** and **Area charts**-to compare trends and job counts.

- **🗺️ Mapping Skills:**
Added a **Map visual** to show global job locations, which was a great introduction to geo-spatial analysis.

- **🔢 Cards & Tables:**
Used **cards** for quick insights and **tables** for detailed job information.

- **🎨 Dashboard Layout & Design:**
Explored different layouts, color schemes, and chart combinations to make the dashboard clean and easy to use.

- **🖱️ Interactivity:**
Practiced key Power BI interactive features:

    - **Slicers** for filtering job titles

    - **Buttons & Bookmarks** for smooth navigation

    - **Drill-Through** to move from a summary view to detailed insights

## Dashboard Overview
The report has two pages, each serving a different purpose.
### Page 1: Market Overview
![Main Dashboard](/JOB%20DATA%20DASHBORD/images/Main%20DashBord.png)
This page gives a quick summary of the data job market-total jobs, median salaries, and top job titles. It helped me understand how to design a visually appealing and easy-to-read summary page.
### Page 2: Drill-Through Job Details
![Drill Through](/JOB%20DATA%20DASHBORD/images/Drill%20Through.png)
This page provides a deeper look into a selected job title, including salary ranges, remote opportunities, top hiring platforms, and a map of job locations. Building this page helped me practice drill-through functionality and more focused data storytelling.
## Conclusion
As a beginner, this project was a great learning experience in turning raw data into something interactive and meaningful. It helped me strengthen my Power BI skills and understand how dashboards can support real-world decision-making-especially for anyone exploring a career in data.
